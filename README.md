# Flag of India - HTML & CSS

## Overview

This project showcases a simple representation of the Indian national flag, created using only HTML and CSS. It is designed as a beginner-friendly exercise to help users understand basic web development concepts. The flag features the traditional tricolor design and includes the Ashoka Chakra with 24 spokes, centrally placed in the white band.

## Features

### Tricolor Design

- **Saffron Band**: Positioned at the top of the flag, representing courage and sacrifice.
- **White Band**: Located in the middle, symbolizing truth and peace.
- **Green Band**: Situated at the bottom, denoting faith and chivalry.

### Ashoka Chakra

- **Design**: A navy blue wheel with 24 equally spaced spokes.
- **Placement**: Centered within the white band of the flag.
- **Creation**: Achieved using CSS properties such as `border-radius` for the circular shape and `transform` for the spoke rotations.

## Technologies Used

### HTML5

- **Purpose**: Provides the structural layout of the flag.
- **Elements**: Utilizes `div` elements to create the tricolor bands and the Ashoka Chakra.

### CSS3
